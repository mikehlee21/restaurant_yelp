### Instructions

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is used for dependency management.

To run this project, CocoaPods should be first installed. CocoaPods is built with Ruby and is installable with the default Ruby available on OS X. To install, issue in terminal:

```ogdl
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Then to install the dependencies needed by this project:
```
$ pod install
```

Make sure to always open the **Xcode workspace (Restaurant Finder.xcworkspace)** instead of the **project file (Restaurant Finder.xcodeproj)** when building your project.

### Yelp API

In the YelpClient.swift file, replace the placeholders with your own [Yelp API keys](https://www.yelp.com/developers/manage_api_keys).
